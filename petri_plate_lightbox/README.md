# Petri Plate Lightbox
These SVG files are designs for laser-cutting a photo box that is well-sized for photographing petri plates. The goal is to provide even lighting within minimal glare from the agar.

The diffusers are sized such that you can fit multiple LED strips into them, in case you would like to include both white light and UV light to capture fluorescence.

The box fits SBS rectangular plates (127mm X 85mm), but can also fit 90mm and smaller round petri plates.

## Use
Position a cell-phone camera directly on top of the lid, so that the lens is looking through the whole in the center of the lid. Turn on the appropriate LEDs and snap a picture!

## Assembly
These designs are meant to be laser cut from 3mm thick material. White or black matte acrylic is recommended.

#### Box
Once cut, assemble the main box by aligning the crenellation of each side. You can glue the sides together, or use a temporary solution like tape - this makes it easier to store the box, and also lets your swap out the bottom piece if you ever want to use a different color background. The top piece should not be attached permanently, as it's meant to be taken off to load objects.

#### Diffusers
Cut the diffusers from 3mm "diffuser" acrylic - this should be partially opaque material with a neutral white color. The diffusers assembly into 4 interlocking boxes, each of which can be mounted along one side of the main box. Before completely assembling the diffusers, stick an [LED strip](https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Upgraded-Dimmable-Daylight-Adhesive/dp/B07XHLGSXN/) along each side. For ease of use, consider connecting each side with a [snap-on LED connector](https://www.amazon.com/HitLights-Light-Strip-Connector-Single/dp/B00QJB6FYO) rather than running the strip all the way around the box.

Both the box and the diffusers have a small gap in one corner where the wire from the LED strip can run out so that it can be plugged in.
