# Hardware Adapters
This repo contains design files and further instructions for assembling 3D printed hardware that adapters to lab automation equipment. Originally forked from [iGEM Marburg's excellent 2019 project](https://github.com/BioArtBot/iGemMarburg2019), this includes hardware for their Colony Picking and Promega Plasmid Purification Protocols, as well as additional labware by them and others.
