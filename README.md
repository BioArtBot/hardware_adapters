# Hardware Adapters
This repo contains design files and further instructions for assembling 3D printed hardware that adapters to lab automation equipment. Originally forked from [iGEM Marburg's excellent 2019 project](https://github.com/BioArtBot/iGemMarburg2019), this includes hardware for their Colony Picking and Promega Plasmid Purification Protocols, as well as additional labware by them and others.

STL files are generally intended to be 3D-printed, while SVG and DXF files generally intended to be cut using a laser cutter.

The 90mm-SBS_BioArtBot file can be assembled by melting 3mm brass inserts into the holes of the base, then fastening the parts that say "BioArtBot" to the base with M3 screws. All other laser cut files are intended to be assembled by lining up the square "fingers" and gluing via chemical welding.
